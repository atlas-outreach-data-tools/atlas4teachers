### You found the Higgs!

Congratulations! Your analysis has led to the identification of the Higgs boson, the particle responsible for giving mass to other particles. This discovery represents one of the most important milestones in modern particle physics.

To help you visualize what you’ve found, let’s take a closer look at some event displays. These displays show real examples of events where the Higgs boson decayed into four leptons, highlighting the tracks and energy deposits recorded by the ATLAS detector. Each event demonstrates a different decay channel and the meticulous reconstruction of the particles involved.

#### Event Displays

- **H → 4e event**

    This event features a Higgs boson decaying into four electrons, with an invariant mass of approximately 124.5 GeV. The tracks and energy clusters of the electron pairs are colored red and blue. The detailed views show the origin of the electrons from the same primary vertex, as well as the transverse energy measured in the calorimeters.

- **H → 4μ event**

    In this event, the Higgs boson decays into four muons, with an invariant mass of around 124.1 GeV. The red tracks represent the muon trajectories, showcasing their clear identification and reconstruction in the detector.

- **H → 2e2μ event**

    This event displays a mixed decay of the Higgs boson into two electrons and two muons, with an invariant mass of approximately 122.6 GeV. The muon tracks are red, and the electron tracks and clusters in the calorimeters are green. Smaller close-up views are included to focus on specific details, such as the region where the leptons originate, confirming that all leptons came from the same interaction point in the detector.

#### Why Luminosity Matters

The amount of data analyzed—referred to as luminosity—directly impacts how clearly we can see the Higgs boson in the invariant mass distribution. To demonstrate this, here is a GIF showing how the invariant mass plot evolves as more data is added. Notice how the Higgs peak becomes sharper and more distinct with increasing luminosity.

This illustrates why you selected luminosity at the start of your analysis: more data improves the signal's visibility, making it easier to identify rare processes like Higgs boson decays

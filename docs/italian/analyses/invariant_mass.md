## Unveiling Particles with Invariant Mass
The **invariant mass** is a fundamental concept in particle physics. It is a quantity derived from the energies and momenta of particles and is particularly useful because it remains the same regardless of the reference frame of the particles involved. When two or more particles are detected, their invariant mass can reveal information about the original particle that decayed to produce them.

For two particles, the invariant mass $M$ is calculated using the following equation:
$$$
M^2 = (E_1+E_2)^2 - (\vec{p_1}+\vec{p_2})^2
$$$

Here $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the energies of the two particles, $\vec{p_1}$ and $\vec{p_2}$ are their momentum vectors, and $M$ is the invariant mass. This invariant mass corresponds to the mass of the parent particle that decayed to produce these two particles.

You'll use invariant mass to identify: 
- The Z boson, by looking at the mass of particle pairs (like electron-positron or muon-antimuon pairs), which will create a distinct peak around 91 GeV if the event selection is done correctly.
- The Higgs boson, by analyzing the invariant mass of four leptons, producing a broader peak that you will discover the value of.

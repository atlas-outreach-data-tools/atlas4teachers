        You are about to select the number of leptons you want in your data. However, it's important to note that we‚Äôve added additional criteria to ensure the quality of these leptons:

        - **Isolation:** Each lepton must be isolated, meaning it isn‚Äôt clustered with other particles. This ensures that we're focusing on leptons that likely originated directly from the particle we‚Äôre interested in, rather than from background interactions.
        - **Identification Levels:** Leptons must meet specific identification criteria to confirm their type with high confidence. Particle reconstruction is complex, so we have different levels of identification for certainty. For example, muons must pass a medium ID level, while electrons only need to pass a loose ID level, as electrons are easier to detect.
        - **Trigger Conditions:** Triggers are criteria set to capture events with certain characteristics, allowing only saving events that we want to analysis. Here, we use electron and muon triggers to select events with significant signals, refining the dataset to increase the chances of observing particles that decay to leptons or muons.

        These criteria help "clean" the data, improving our chances of observing particles like the Z and Higgs bosons.

One of the ways we can do this is by focusing on a variable called **transverse momentum** (p$_T$), which represents the momentum of particles perpendicular to the beamline.

Each lepton in our data has a p$_T$ value, which we‚Äôve recorded in descending order as **leading** (highest p$_T$), **sub-leading**, and so forth. By examining these values, we can apply cuts to keep data that better resembles the Higgs boson's characteristics, while reducing data less likely to contain it.

One approach to isolating the Higgs is to apply cuts that remove regions where the **background** (data not related to the Higgs, but similar) tends to dominate, leaving more events that match our Higgs-like signature. This means setting a lower limit on the p$_T$ for leptons, as higher p$_T$ values are more likely to capture the events we‚Äôre interested in.

The plots below show the p$_T$ distributions for the first, second, and third leptons in both simulated signal (the Higgs that we are looking for) and background data. Applying cuts to the lower p$_T$ values could help reduce the background and improve the visibility of potential Higgs events.

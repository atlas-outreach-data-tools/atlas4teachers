## How much data do you want to use?
Begin your analysis by choosing how much data you'd like to work with. Use the slider below to select the integrated luminosity, which is a measure of how much data the ATLAS detector has collected during its operations. In this case, we are using data recorded in 2015 and 2016.

In particle physics, **luminosity** refers to the number of particle collisions occurring in the detector over time. The **integrated luminosity** is the total number of collisions recorded, expressed in units called inverse femtobarns (fb⁻¹). For reference, 1 fb⁻¹ corresponds to roughly 100 trillion particle collisions.

The more data (or collisions) you analyze, the better your chances of observing rare events. Rare processes, like the decay of a Higgs boson, occur very infrequently compared to more common events. By analyzing more collisions, you effectively create more opportunities for these rare events to occur and be captured in the data.

Use the slider below to choose how much integrated luminosity to analyze. Keep in mind, while more data increases your chances of finding rare particles, it may also take longer to process, because the computer needs to work through a larger number of recorded events to find the ones that match your selection.

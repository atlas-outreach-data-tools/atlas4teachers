## Cuts on Leptons p$_T$
To create a clearer and more visible plot of the Higgs boson, we focus on the transverse momentum (p$_T$) of leptons. This quantity measures how much momentum a particle has perpendicular to the beamline. Each lepton in an event is ranked by p$_T$, with the leading lepton having the highest value, followed by the sub-leading, and so on.

By examining the p$_T$ distributions for the leading, sub-leading, and third leptons, we can refine our selection to reduce background events and highlight the Higgs signal. The goal is to improve the quality of the final invariant mass plot, making the Higgs peak more distinct and easier to identify. Through this process, we want to enhance the visibility of the Higgs bosonâ€™s signature againts other data.

The plots below show the p$_T$ distributions for the leading, sub-leading, and third leptons in both simulated signal (events containing the Higgs boson) and background (events not related to the Higgs but similar). To identify where to place p$_T$ cuts, look for regions where the signal (Higgs events) stands out compared to the background.

In particular:

- Notice the shape and range of the p$_T$ distributions for the Higgs signal. These show where Higgs events are most likely to appear.
- Compare these to the background distributions. Areas with significant overlap between signal and background are less helpful for distinguishing Higgs events, while areas with less background are more promising.
- Focus on the low-p$_T$ regions where the background dominates, as this is where cuts can effectively reduce noise without losing too many signal events.

By analyzing these distributions, you can decide on appropriate p$_T$ thresholds for each lepton to maximize the Higgs signal's visibility.

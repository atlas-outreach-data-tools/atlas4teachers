# Explore the Z and Higgs Bosons Through Data from the ATLAS Experiment!
Dive into experimental data with this interactive app! By applying your own selection criteria to filter events, you'll uncover the signatures of the Z and Higgs bosons in the resulting plots. Experience the thrill of discovery just like a particle physicist!

### Objectives
In these analyses, you will:

- Understand the concept of invariant mass: A key quantity in particle physics, invariant mass is calculated from the momenta and energies of detected particles and reveals information about their parent particles.
- Identify the Z boson: By examining the invariant mass of particle pairs, you'll reveal a sharp peak at the Z boson's mass.
- Uncover the Higgs boson decaying to ZZ: You'll produce a plot of the invariant mass of four leptons, getting the signature of the Higgs boson in the Higgs to ZZ channel.

Below are the plots we’re aiming for in this analysis:

These example plots are not just toy examples; they represent results from real analyses conducted at the ATLAS experiment, using data collected from high-energy particle collisions. As you progress, we’ll explain how these plots are created and what they reveal about these fundamental particles.

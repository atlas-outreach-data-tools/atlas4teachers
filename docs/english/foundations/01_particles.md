# What are Particles?
We’ll start with something that might sound familiar: the atom. Picture it initially as a tiny solar system, with a dense nucleus of protons and neutrons at the center, and electrons moving around this nucleus.

Unlike planets, electrons don't orbit in fixed paths. Instead, they exist in “clouds” or regions where we are likely to find them, a concept shaped by [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_quantum_mechanics). This gives atoms a structure that’s quite different from the classic solar system model.

Within this tiny structure, different forces hold everything together. For example:

- **Electromagnetic force** keeps negatively charged electrons bound to the positively charged nucleus.
- **Strong nuclear force** binds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus, overcoming the natural repulsion between positively charged protons.

As fundamental as atoms may seem, they’re actually made up of even smaller particles. Protons and neutrons consist of quarks, bound together by particles called gluons, which act as “force carriers” for the strong nuclear force.

Electrons, however, as well as quarks and gluons, are part of a group called **fundamental particles**, meaning they aren’t made of anything smaller.

These tiny particles and their interactions are at the center of particle physics, and understanding them brings us to the **Standard Model**, a theory that organizes and explains the particles and forces shaping the universe.
